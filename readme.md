# 💳 Credit Card Generator Website

The **Credit Card Generator** is a simple web-based tool developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to generate fake (non-functional) credit card numbers for testing, learning, and development purposes. These numbers follow valid formatting and Luhn's algorithm but are not connected to real accounts.

- Can be used for **testing or form validation**, **not for real transactions**
